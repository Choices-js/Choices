# Changelog

## [10.3.0] (2024-07-30)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* Templates/text functions now escape `'` for display, as this might escape custom templates.

### Features

* Remove `deepMerge` dependency for a custom extend, reduces minified javascript by ~2kb.
* `Remove item text` can be localized.
* Allow user-created choices for selects. #1117
* Render options without a group even if groups are present.
* Read `data-labelclass`/`data-label-description` from `<option>` HTML to drive adding a per-choice CSS label and description text when `allowHtml: false`.
* Add `removeItemButtonAlignLeft` option, to control if the remove item button is at the start or the end of the item.
* Add `removeChoice` method.
* Improve rendering performance by batching changes.
* Provide original templates via a new argument to the `callbackOnCreateTemplates` callback. #1149
* Templates now render escaped html to innerHtml instead of switching to innerText when allowHtml config is false.
  This provides consistent rendering performance as innerText is quirky and slower than just inserting pure text into HTML.
* Add ``
